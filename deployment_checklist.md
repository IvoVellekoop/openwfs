- Update CHANGELOG.md.  Use `git log v1.1.0..HEAD --oneline` (replacing the tag by the version of the last release)
- Update the version number in `pypoetry.toml`
- Merge all to master on GitHub
- Check that the tests pass
- Check if the documentation on `openwfs.readthedocs.io` is up to date
- Create a new release on GitHub (on the main page of the repository, click on "Releases" in the right-hand-side bar and then "Draft a new release"). 
  - Copy the relevant section from CHANGELOG.md
  - Create a new tag and verify that it matches the tag in `pypoetry.toml` with a `rc` suffix (e.g. 1.1.0rc)
  - Select the "prerelease" option
  - Verify that the package is deployed to test.pypi.org. If not, check if the pypi.yaml GitHub action succeeded. 
- If all works well, publish the real release. On GitHub, click on "Releases" and repeat the steps above. Leave out the "rc" suffix and the "prerelease" option.
