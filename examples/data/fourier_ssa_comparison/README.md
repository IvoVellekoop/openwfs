# Basic Fourier & SSA data

This contains the result of a Fourier-based & SSA WFS experiment for a sample containing fluorescent beads at 
a depth of 60 micrometer behind a rough scattering interface. 

the optimised wavefront can be set in the simulation as the correct wavefront to show realistic simulation behaviour.
