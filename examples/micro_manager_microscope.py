""" Micro-Manager simulated microscope
======================================================================
This script simulates a microscope with a random noise image as a mock specimen.
The numerical aperture, stage position, and other parameters can be modified through the Micro-Manager GUI.
To use this script as a device in Micro-Manager, make sure you have the PyDevice adapter installed and
select this script in the hardware configuration wizard for the PyDevice component.

See the 'Sample Microscope' example for a microscope simulation that runs from Python directly.
