# OpenWFS examples
The files in this folder can be run as stand-alone scripts and demonstrate the functionality of the framework.

Some of these files (the ones that generate a `devices` dictionary) can also be run from micro-manager.

For those new to OpenWFS, JuPyter notebooks were created to introduce the package.
