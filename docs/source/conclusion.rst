Conclusion
====================

In this work we present OpenWFS, a user- and developer-focused open-source wavefront shaping package. In OpenWFS, important features for WFS development such as hardware synchronization, physical units and experiment simulation are built in. This significantly benefits development by allowing faster prototyping and preventing errors. Generalized templates exist for separate components of wavefront shaping, allowing developers to use and expand the growing list of components with ease. This allows cooperative development of complex functionality, which is a major bottleneck in current WFS development. Additionally, standardized components and algorithms will greatly enhance users ability to employ wavefront shaping for different setups and experiments, ushering in a new phase of practical application in wavefront shaping.

We therefore encourage the reader to join us in developing new algorithms and components for this framework.
