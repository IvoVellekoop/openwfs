    abstract = {Aberrations and scattering limit the ability of optical microscopy to penetrate deep tissues. Adaptive optics (AO) is a very effective technique to correct for smooth aberrations. Wavefront shaping (WFS) techniques, on the other hand, compensate both scattering and aberrations and have guaranteed convergence even for finding high-dimensional corrections. However, if it is known in advance that the required corrections should be smooth, WFS is suboptimal because it does not use this a priori information. Here, we combine the best of AO and WFS by introducing a WFS method that takes into account the smoothness of the required correction. Our method is numerically stable and robust against noise, and it can find the corrections for multiple targets simultaneously. We experimentally confirmed that this method outperforms existing WFS techniques, especially in forward scattering samples.},

However, the tissue penetration depth of laser scanning microscopy is limited by light scattering and/or absorption by the tissue. Recently, several optical clearing reagents have been proposed for visualization in fixed specimens. However, they require complicated protocols or long treatment times. Here we report the effects of 2,2′-thiodiethanol (TDE) solutions as an optical clearing reagent for fixed mouse brains expressing a yellow fluorescent protein. Immersion of fixed brains in TDE solutions rapidly (within 30 min in the case of 400-μm-thick fixed brain slices) increased their transparency and enhanced the penetration depth in both confocal and two-photon microscopy. In addition, we succeeded in visualizing dendritic spines along single dendrites at deep positions in fixed thick brain slices. These results suggest that our proposed protocol using TDE solution is a rapid and useful method for optical clearing of fixed specimens expressing fluorescent proteins.},

Although a fast DOPC approach was recently developed, the reported single-shot wavefront measurement method does not work when the goal is to focus light inside, instead of through, highly scattering media. Here, using a ferroelectric liquid crystal based spatial light modulator, we develop a simpler but faster DOPC system that focuses light not only through, but also inside scattering media. By controlling 2.6\&\#x00D7;105 optical degrees of freedom, our system focused light through 3 mm thick moving chicken tissue, with a system latency of 3.0 ms. Using ultrasound-guided DOPC, along with a binary wavefront measurement method, our system focused light inside a scattering medium comprising moving tissue with a latency of 6.0 ms, which is one to two orders of magnitude shorter than those of previous digital wavefront shaping systems. Since the demonstrated speed approaches tissue decorrelation rates, this work is an important step toward in vivo deep-tissue non-invasive optical imaging, manipulation, and therapy.},

@article{Tzang2019,
    abstract = {Recent developments in the field of wavefront shaping (WFS) have demonstrated control and optical focusing through complex media 1,2. Coherent light in such media generates randomly scattered light fields that are seen as random three-dimensional (3D) interference patterns, known as speckles 3. Speckle fields can be manipulated by controlling the incident wavefront to generate enhanced intensity speckles at desired locations. Methods for focusing light through scattering media require an adaptive feedback process or phase conjugation to approximate the optical modes in the random media. Recent methods include wavefront optimization 4-6 and direct inversion of the measured transmission matrix (TM) 7. Unfortunately, dynamic changes in random scattering media lead to speckle field variations that thwart these processes. The speckle decorrelation time is defined as the time during which the correlation between the speckle field and an initial speckle field remains above a predetermined value. When focusing through scattering media using WFS, the speckle decorrelation reduces the intensity of the obtained focus over time. Dynamic biological tissues are extremely challenging for WFS focusing because fast physical changes such as blood flow reduce decorrelation times to the millisecond range. Typically, WFS is performed using high-resolution liquid crystal (LC) spatial light modulators (SLMs) and deform-able mirrors. LC-SLM devices are characterized by refresh rates in the order of 2-100 ms. State-of-the-art methodologies for faster wavefront optimization include micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) based mirror arrays 8 , the use of binary deformable mirror devices (DMD) in a phase modulation configuration 9,10 , optical phase conjugation 11 and a binary ferro-electric LC-SLM 12. These recent methodologies improve the focusing speed over those of traditional SLM-based techniques but are still limited by the SLM's update rate and the use of a binary phase wavefront that results in a lower enhancement potential. Moreover, phase conjugation focus-ing suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with feedback-based WFS, because it requires a light source inside or behind the scattering layer 13. In this Article, we investigate the use of fast 1D SLMs for 2D WFS by taking advantage of the scattering medium to perform a 1D-to-2D transformation. Physically, a highly complex medium randomizes the degrees of freedom by spreading individual 1D modes into uncorrelated 2D speckle fields, and hence provides a means to control the speckle field in space by transforming a 1D optical signal into a 2D signal, as depicted schematically in Fig. 1. Mathematically, the 1D signal utilizes only a fraction of the total degrees of freedom of the incident field 14,15 , while scattering, represented by a random TM, spreads these modes irrespective of the particular selection of degrees of freedom. This phenomenon is analogous to the coupling between temporal/spectral and spatial modes in a scatterer 2,15,16. We utilize a grating light valve (GLV), which is a high-speed 1D MEMs SLM, to speed up feedback-based focusing through complex media. The GLV is composed of thousands of free-standing silicon nitride ribbons on a silicon chip, segmented into 1,088 pixels, each composed of six ribbons as depicted in Fig. 1. By electronically controlling the deflection of the ribbons, the GLV functions as a programmable 1D phase modulator. The GLV allows fast (<300 ns) switching time and high-repetition-rate operation (350 kHz in our case) along with continuous phase modulation. These properties allow three to four orders of magnitude faster operation compared to LC-SLMs, and more than one order of magnitude faster operation compared to binary amplitude DMDs and other binary phase modulators 8-12. However, utilizing the GLV device for focusing in complex media requires tailored optical design as well as custom software-hardware implementation and signal processing. This Article is organized as follows: we first describe and analyse the physical principle of 1D-to-2D transformation by a complex medium. We then describe the optical system utilized for WFS focusing in scattering media, and present experiments showing real-time fast focusing in static and dynamic media that is one order of magnitude faster than what was previously possible. We further demonstrate that the technique is appropriate for focusing in mul-timode fibres (MMFs) and discuss its advantages and limitations. Controlling the propagation and interaction of light in complex media has sparked major interest in the past few years. Unfortunately, spatial light modulation devices suffer from limited speed, which precludes real-time applications such as imaging in live tissue. To address this critical problem, we introduce a phase-control technique to characterize complex media based on the use of fast one-dimensional (1D) spatial light modulators and a 1D-to-2D transformation performed by the same medium being analysed. We implement the concept using a microelectromechanical grating light valve with 1,088 degrees of freedom, modulated at 350 kHz, enabling unprecedented high-speed wavefront measurements. We continuously measure the transmission matrix, calculate the optimal wavefront and project a focus through various dynamic scattering samples in real time, all within 2.4 ms per cycle. These results improve the previously achieved wavefront shaping modulation speed by more than an order of magnitude and open new opportunities for optical processing using 1D-to-2D transformations.

However, tissue scattering, optical aberrations and motion artifacts degrade the imaging performance at depth. Here we describe a minimally invasive intravital imaging methodology based on three-photon excitation, indirect adaptive optics (AO) and active electrocardiogram gating to advance deep-tissue imaging. Our modal-based, sensorless AO approach is robust to low signal-to-noise ratios as commonly encountered in deep scattering tissues such as the mouse brain, and permits AO correction over large axial fields of view. We demonstrate near-diffraction-limited imaging of deep cortical spines and (sub)cortical dendrites up to a depth of 1.4 mm (the edge of the mouse CA1 hippocampus). In addition, we show applications to deep-layer calcium imaging of astrocytes, including fibrous astrocytes that reside in the highly scattering corpus callosum. Three-photon microscopy in combination with adaptive optics-based aberration correction and ECG-triggered gating allows high-resolution imaging of neurons and astrocytes up to a depth of 1.4 mm in the mouse brain.},

@article{Liew2016,
    abstract = {A fundamental issue that limits the efficiency of many photoelectrochemical systems is that the photon absorption length is typically much longer than the electron diffusion length. Various photon management schemes have been developed to enhance light absorption; one simple approach is to use randomly scattering media to enable broadband and wide-angle enhancement. However, such systems are often opaque, making it difficult to probe photoinduced processes. Here we use wave interference effects to modify the spatial distribution of light inside a highly scattering dye-sensitized solar cell to control photon absorption in a space-dependent manner. By shaping the incident wavefront of a laser beam, we enhance or suppress photocurrent by increasing or decreasing light concentration on the front side of the mesoporous photoanode where the collection efficiency of photoelectrons is maximal. Enhanced light absorption is achieved by reducing reflection through the open boundary of the photoanode via destructive interference, leading to a factor of 2 increase in photocurrent. This approach opens the door to probing and manipulating photoelectrochemical processes in specific regions inside nominally opaque media.},

The program uses a class-based structure to separate out the universal modules (e.g. GUI, multithreading, optimization algorithms) and hardware-specific modules (e.g. code for different SLMs and cameras). This modular design makes the program easily adaptable to a wide range of lab equipment, while providing easy access to a GUI, multithreading, and three optimization algorithms (phase-stepping, simple genetic, and microgenetic).},

@article{Bachelard2014,
    abstract = {A laser is not necessarily a sophisticated device: pumping an amplifying medium randomly filled with scatterers makes a perfectly viable â ̃ random laserâ ™. The absence of mirrors greatly simplifies laser design, but control over the emission wavelength and directionality is lost, seriously hindering prospects for this otherwise simple laser. Recently, we proposed an approach to tame random lasers, inspired by coherent light control in complex media. Here, we implement this method in an optofluidic random laser where modes are spatially extended and overlap, making individual mode selection impossible, a priori. We show experimentally that control over laser emission can be regained even in this extreme case. By actively shaping the optical pump within the random laser, single-mode operation at any selected wavelength is achieved with spectral selectivity down to 0.06 nm and more than 10 dB side-lobe rejection. This method paves the way towards versatile tunable and controlled random lasers as well as the taming of other laser sources. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Due to the dispersion caused by multiple light scattering, light propagation through turbid media can be independently controlled between different wavelengths. Foci with various wavelengths can be generated by applying different optimized wavefronts to a highly scattering layer. Given the linearity of the transmission matrix, multiple foci with different wavelengths can also be simultaneously constructed.},

    abstract = {Wavefront shaping is increasingly being used in modern microscopy to obtain high-resolution images deep inside inhomogeneous media. Wavefront shaping methods typically rely on the presence of a ``guide star'' to find the optimal wavefront to mitigate the scattering of light. However, the use of guide stars poses severe limitations. Notably, only objects in the close vicinity of the guide star can be imaged. Here, we introduce a guide-star-free wavefront shaping method in which the optimal wavefront is computed using a digital model of the sample. The refractive index model of the sample, that serves as the input for the computation, is constructed in situ by the microscope itself. In a proof of principle imaging experiment, we demonstrate a large improvement in the two-photon fluorescence signal through a diffuse medium, outperforming state-of-the-art wavefront shaping by a factor of two in imaging depth.},
