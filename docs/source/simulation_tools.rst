Simulations
=======================
OpenWFS provides an extensive framework for testing and simulating wavefront shaping algorithms, including the effect of measurement noise, stage drift, and user-defined aberrations. This allows for rapid prototyping and testing of new algorithms, without the need for physical hardware.

TODO: introduction, explain Microscope, SimulatedWFS classes.
Explain ADCConverter, Camera classes (for adding noise).
Give example of a simulated WFS experiment.
