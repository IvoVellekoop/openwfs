# Documentation

- General documentation is written in reStructuredText format, and stored in the `docs` directory.
- All public functions and classes should have docstrings, written in the Google style.
- Input arguments and return values should be type hinted in the function header only, not in the docstring.

# General

- PyCharm autoformatting should be enabled to ensure correct formatting.
